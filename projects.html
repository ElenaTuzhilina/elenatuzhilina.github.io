<h2>Weighted Low Rank Matrix Approximation and Acceleration</h2>

<p>Low-rank matrix approximation is one of the central concepts in machine learning, 
with applications in dimension reduction, de-noising, multivariate statistical methodology, and many more.
A recent extension to LRMA is called low-rank matrix completion (LRMC). 
It solves the LRMA problem when some observations are missing and is especially useful 
for recommender systems. In this project, we consider an element-wise weighted generalization of LRMA. 
WLRMA has many applications. For example, it is an essential component of GLM optimization algorithms, 
where an exponential family is used to model the entries of a matrix, and the matrix 
of natural parameters admits a low-rank structure.  </p>

<h2>Canonical Correlation Analysis in high dimensions with structured regularization</h2>

<td align="left"><p><b>April 2020 &ndash; present</b>, Stanford University, Stanford, USA</p>
<p>Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a technique that allows to measure the 
association between two multivariate sets of variables. 
The Regularized modification of Canonical Correlation Analysis (RCCA) 
is widely used to conduct the analysis of high dimensional data. 
One limitation of RCCA is that it treats all features equally. 
In this project we introduce several modifications of RCCA utilizing 
the underlying data structure and 
suggesting some tricks that allows to avoid excessive computations 
while conducting CCA with regularization. </p>

<td align="left"><p><b>2018 &ndash; present</b>, Stanford University, Stanford, USA</p>
<p><i>Description</i>: Three dimensional (3D) genome spatial organization is critical for numerous cellular processes. 
Genome architecture had been 
notoriously difficult to elucidate, but the advent of the suite of 
chromatin conformation capture assays, notably Hi-C, has transformed 
understanding of chromatin structure and provided downstream biological insights. 
In this project we target finding a chromatin spatial conformation.
We exploit the fact that single chromosome solutions constitute a one dimensional (1D) curve in 3D.
The resulting PoisMS technique thereby combines principal curve methodology with the metric scaling approach. </p>

<h2>Weighted Low Rank Matrix Approximation</h2>

<td align="left"><p><b>April 2020 &ndash; June 2020</b>, Stanford University, Stanford, USA</p>
<p><i>Description</i>: The Low-rank matrix-completion (LRC) problem has always 
attracted a lot of attention. One of the most famous applications 
can be found in Netflix Problem, which aims to build a movie 
recommendation system based on partial user's movie ratings. 
The general LRC problem statement is: given some incomplete matrix
find a low-rank matrix that provides the best approximation 
to its observed entries. 
In this project we consider the generalization of LRC problem 
introducing weights in the problem set-up and stating 
the Weighted Low Rank Matrix Approximation (WLRA) problem. 
We suggest several optimization algorithms solving this problem
and compare them in terms of convergence. </p>

<td align="left"><p><b>April 2020 &ndash; June 2020</b>, Stanford University, Stanford, USA</p>
<p><i>Description</i>: As of June 12th 2020, there have been 7,739,944 cases and 428,337 deaths 
as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic as per the World Health Organization COVID-19 Dashboard. 
The countries around the world have imposed restrictions in the form of the lockdown to combat 
the rate of the spread and flatten the curve describing the number of patients admitted to hospital per day.
Currently most of governments are planning their post-lockdown reopening procedures and methods 
to monitor the spread of the disease. However, limited tested capabilities, varying quality of the tests, 
and a large number of asymptomatic carriers make 
this task particularly challenging. 
In this project we attempt to build a classifier to diagnose 
the patient based on the cough recording and general patient information 
collected by the hospital staff. The data was provided by the Wadhwani Institute of 
Artificial Intelligence.</p>

<p><i>Description</i>: Flourished throughout Europe and the United
States at the turn of 19th and 20th centuries, Art
Nouveau still remains one of the most beautiful
decorative art movements. Promulgating the
idea of art and design as part of everyday life and
inspired by natural forms and patterns of plants
and flowers, it has influenced different aspects
of art and architecture, such as interior, furnishings
and glass design, as well as graphic work,
posters, and illustration. This project inspired by
Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec and Alphonse Mucha
works of art is aimed to develop a deep learning
tool transforming already boring photos into
a bright and bold Art Nouveau fine art posters.</p>

<p><i>Description</i>: It takes some time for a human being to conceive the differences between two of the most well-known
impressionist painters Claude Monet and Edouard Manet. Although quite cultivated the French beau
monde of the nineteenth century had a struggle with this problem as well. When Claude Monet made his
debut at the salon in Paris in 1865, his landscapes were displayed next to the famous painting &ldquo;Olympia&rdquo;
by Edouard Manet who was already known at the time. Funnily enough, people could not recognize the difference between the paintings of these two artists.

<p><i>Description</i>: Chromatin landscapes provide critical insight into the transcriptional regulation of

multiple high-throughput sequencing assays, creating the desire for a single

sequencing (PRO-seq) &ndash; to impute H3K4me3, H3K27ac, H3K27me3, and

<p><i>Description</i>:
The main goal of the project can be stated as follows. Given the complete information about translators 
in a marketplace such as average translation pace (words per hour), translation price (cents per word), customer feedbacks
and customers rating, texts of the projects translated along with translation mistakes made (detected automatically 
by system or manually by reviewer or corrector) find the most efficient translator for the new project. By efficiency of the translator
we imply that such translator would meet time and price restrictions imposed by the customer and would 
produce the translation of the highest possible quality.</p>

<p><i>Description</i>:
In this project the geometry of polypeptides is investigated by means of geometrical and statistical methods.
One part of this project is devoted to the analysis of the information contained in Protein Data Bank. In particular, 
we have tested several characteristics (such as covalent bonds lengths and angles, cis&ndash;trans isomerism or Pauling plane low) 
of PDB conformations for consistency and general theory fitting.
The second part is focused on geometrical modeling of polypeptides. We consider several approaches 
to polypeptides modeling (e.g by a polygonal chain with fixed edge lengths or by a smooth curve) and investigate
folding properties of the suggested models.</p>
